            Computer Memory Systems
            
            Computer memory systems are essential components that store and retrieve data for processing. 
            There are several types of memory, each serving different purposes in the computing hierarchy.
            
            RAM (Random Access Memory) is volatile memory that provides fast access to data and instructions. 
            It loses its contents when power is turned off, but offers the fastest read and write speeds.
            
            ROM (Read-Only Memory) is non-volatile memory that contains permanent instructions and data. 
            It cannot be modified during normal operation and retains data even when power is off.
            
            Cache memory is a small, high-speed memory that stores frequently accessed data. It acts as a 
            buffer between the CPU and main memory, significantly improving system performance.
            
            Memory hierarchy refers to the organization of different memory types based on speed, cost, and capacity. 
            The hierarchy typically includes CPU registers, cache, RAM, and storage devices.
            
            Memory controllers manage data flow between the CPU and memory modules. They optimize memory 
            access patterns and ensure data integrity through error correction mechanisms.
            
            Performance optimization in memory systems involves balancing speed, capacity, and cost. 
            Techniques include caching strategies, memory mapping, and bandwidth optimization.
